# Performance & Security

## Performance Targets

### Memory Usage
- Virtual filesystem should handle 1000+ packages efficiently
- Implement lazy loading for package contents
- Use weak references where appropriate
- Monitor and prevent memory leaks

### Network Efficiency
- Batch registry requests where possible
- Implement connection pooling
- Use compression (gzip/brotli) when available
- Cache aggressively with proper invalidation

### Bundle Size
- Keep browser bundle under 100KB gzipped
- Use tree-shaking friendly exports
- Lazy load non-critical functionality
- Provide ESM and CommonJS builds

## Security Considerations

### Package Safety
- Validate package integrity with checksums
- Sandbox package extraction
- Limit resource usage (memory, time)
- Validate package metadata structure

### Network Security
- Use HTTPS only
- Validate SSL certificates
- Implement request signing for authenticated registries
- Rate limit outbound requests

## Debugging and Observability

### Debugging Tools
- Provide filesystem inspection utilities
- Include dependency graph visualization
- Support verbose logging modes
- Implement performance profiling hooks

### Metrics
- Track operation durations
- Monitor cache hit rates
- Count network requests and retries
- Measure memory usage patterns

### Logging
- Use structured logging with levels
- Include correlation IDs for tracing operations
- Log performance metrics
- Respect user privacy (no sensitive data in logs)
